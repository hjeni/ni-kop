# NI-KOP

Lib created while working on NI-KOP (Combinatorial Optimization) tasks at FIT-CTU

<hr/>

## koplib

NI-KOP library, contains implementation of different algorithms used through the semester of studying NI-KOP. 

There were 5 tasks during the semester and the library was used as a backbone of all handed-in solutions (in IPYNB format). Because of that, the library itself does not include all the code written during the semester, but all the important parts are present. 

## semestral_wrok

Exemplar IPYNB notebook which leverages the **koplib** (solution to the last, semestral task)
