# NI-KOP

Lib created while working on NI-KOP (Combinatorial Optimization) tasks at FIT-CTU

<hr/>

## koplib

NI-KOP package, contains implementation of different algorithms used through the semester of studying NI-KOP. 

There were 5 tasks during the semester and the library was used as a backbone of all handed-in solutions (in IPYNB format). Because of that, the library itself does not include all the code written during the semester, but all the important parts are present. 

The package is not made installable - the homeworks are handed in as reports and it is sufficient to import the package modules locally during development. 

## semestral_work

Exemplar IPYNB notebook which leverages the **koplib** package (solution to the last, semestral task)
